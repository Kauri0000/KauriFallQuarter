1. What are the 7 stated factors to consider when choosing a location for your business?
Business Type, Location Needs, Budget, Stakeholders, Location Amenities, Saturation, Zoning Laws

2. Which business type is the easiest to launch in terms of location? Why?
Solo services, because they are launched from home

For questions 3 - 7, use your own business idea to answer.

3. What would be the business type for your idea? What are examples of other businesses of that same type?
Interactive Service and maybe In-Person Retail for my idea. Examples of other businesses of that same type are places that do private lessons and sell equipment, real life example, Guitar Center. Another one is Sweetwater Sound .

4. Create a list of everyhting your business would need to launch and maintain, then find an example of a location that checks all those boxes. Where is that location?
My business would need high demand and supplies. An example of that location would be between El Sobrante and Pinole.

5. Who are the main stakeholders of your business? what location ameneties do you think they need most based on your business idea?

Stakeholders of my business would think that it be near the main road, so employees without a car can arrive via public transportation, an employee-only parking section at the back of the business location amenities would be a free parking lot, easy access from the main roads, and near decently good neighborhoods.

6. Take the location you chose from question 4. How saturated is that area? What businesses similar to yours are within 5 miles of your location? What are examples of other busineses in the area that are complimentary to yours?
The area is very saturated as there is big neighborhoods around the area, nothing ghetto. Dog walking buisnesses and adoption places but they arent really that close and personal house care takers.
I wouldnt say there are any complimentary places compared to mine.


7. What are zoning laws? Take the location you chose in question 4. Research and find one zoning law that applies to the type of your business idea.
